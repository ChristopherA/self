## About me

My name is Christopher Allen, and a short summary of my bio is:

> Principal Architect at Blockstream — Internet Cryptography Pioneer —  Co-author TLS Security Standard —Collaborative Tools & Patterns — Decentralized Identity

My Blockstream bio paragraph is:

> Christopher Allen is a veteran of the Crypto Wars with a wealth of knowledge about the history of internet cryptography, including both successes and paths not taken. That dates back to his founding of Consensus Development, where he co-authored the IETF TLS 1.0 standard and produced the first commercial SSL and TLS toolkits. After Consensus merged with elliptic-curve pioneer Certicom, Christopher worked on early smart contract technology as the company’s CTO. Though he detoured into creating internet communities, teaching technological leadership, and producing mobile apps, the lure of enabling trust drew Christopher back to the field. Recently, Christopher was VP of Developer Relations for the secure smartphone company Silent Circle. He has also taught at Blockchain University, advised multiple organizations on privacy and security, and produced a design workshop on the Web of Trust. Now at Blockstream, he is Principal Architect, working especially on blockchain standards, decentralized identity and new engines of trust. Christopher also plays the hand pan and enjoys eurogames and noir films.

I do accept direct messages from people I follow, but it email is better.

## Recent Online Publications

Since 2003 I have been sharing about my professional life in my blog [Life With Alacrity](http://www.LifeWithAlacrity.com), where I discuss on a variety of topics including entrepreneurship, the social web, identity & privacy,  internet security and collaboration.

Many of my more recent public collaborations (not only about code) are on [Github](https://github.com/ChristopherA). My goal over the next couple of years is to move many of my prior collaborations into Github under permissive sharing licenses.

## Github Communities

* I am founder and host of [#RebootingWebOfTrust](http://www.WebOfTrust.info), a decentralized digital identity community that also meets F2F twice a year. It uses extensively https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo for documents collaboratively created by its members.

* I am an active member of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and am Blockstream representative to the W3C's AC (Advisory Committee). In particular, I am co-chair of the [W3C Credentials WG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/), which uses https://github.com/w3c-ccg and am deeply involved in the [W3C Verifiable Claims WG](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/), which uses https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/ https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/.

* I have a passion about collaborative & participatory organizations, and have tried to create a community on this topic at https://github.com/participatoryorgs — however, at this time I'm the only active contributor.

## Scheduling Meetings with Me

I live in Lafayette, CA, in the east bay of the San Francisco bay area past Berkeley and Oakland. When I'm not traveling for various conferences and meetings, I BART into Blockstream's San Francisco (most reliably on Wednesdays) or drive down to Blockstream's Mountain View office (many Tuesdays), otherwise I typically do my intellectual work from my home office.

Based on that typical schedule, I usually schedule my face-to-face meetings in SF (most Wednesdays) or Mountain View (many Tuesdays), and online meetings or calls on Mondays, Thursdays or Fridays.
